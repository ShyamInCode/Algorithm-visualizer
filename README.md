# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Description
This interactive web application visualizes various sorting algorithms with the added feature of sound using the Web Audio API. Users can see how different algorithms approach the task of sorting and hear the differences as each element is moved, providing an engaging multi-sensory experience. This could be particularly useful for educational purposes, making algorithm concepts more accessible and engaging for users.

## Features
- **Interactive Sorting Visualization**: See how different sorting algorithms sort data in real-time.
- **Auditory Feedback**: Each action is accompanied by sound, illustrating the algorithm's process audibly.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to visualize and hear.
- **Customizable Data Sets**: Input your own data sets for sorting or use pre-defined samples.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the application.
3. click on new to get different random arrays to visualize the bubble sort algorithm.
4. Press 'play' to begin the visualization and auditory display.
