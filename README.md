The project shows the development of an interactive web application designed to demonstrate sorting algorithms.
The application was built using fundamental web technologies, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
A notable feature of this application is the integration of auditory feedback through the Web Audio API, which allows users to hear the sorting process as it happens, providing a multi-sensory learning experience.
This could be particularly useful for educational purposes, making algorithm concepts more accessible and engaging for users.
